## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.3] - 2024-09-16
- CDERunJobOperator 429 response code attempts are now counted separately during retries
- TaskFlow decorator implementation for CDERunJobOperator
- CdpAccessKeyV2TokenAuth is now usable with Private Cloud CDE deployments
- CI fixes.
- Add support for the Test connection functionality on the Airflow UI

## [2.1.2] - 2023-04-24
- Enhanced handling of HTTP 429 on job submission for retries.
- When rate limited:
1. Use wait time as specified in "Retry-After" HTTP response header.
2. Simple retry, no exponential retry
3. More retries, but only retrying for 2 hours at most
- Better logging for retries: wait / stop handlers

## [2.1.1] - 2023-02-21

- Added handling of HTTP 429 on job submission for retries.
- reduce the number of warnings in the logs if the `AIRFLOW__CDE__DEFAULT_NUM_RETRIES`
  or `AIRFLOW__CDE__DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT` config values are not set.

## [2.1.0] - 2023-02-01

New environment variables allow to modify the `api_retries` and
`api_timeout` values used by the cde hook:
- `AIRFLOW__CDE__DEFAULT_NUM_RETRIES` to set the `api_retries` value.
- `AIRFLOW__CDE__DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT` to set the `api_timeout` value.

The value precedence is 'parameter' > 'env var' > 'airflow.cfg' > 'default'.

With the environemt variables it is easier to fine tune the values without the
need to modify the existing DAG files.
