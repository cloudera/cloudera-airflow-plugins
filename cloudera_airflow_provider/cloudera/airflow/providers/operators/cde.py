class CdeRunJobOperator(BaseOperator):
    """
    Runs a job in a CDE Virtual Cluster. The ``CdeRunJobOperator`` runs the
    named job with optional variables and overrides. The job and its resources
    must have already been created via the specified virtual cluster jobs API.

    The virtual cluster API endpoint is specified by setting the
    ``connection_id`` parameter. The "local" virtual cluster jobs API is the
    default and has a special value of ``cde_runtime_api``. Authentication to
    the API is handled automatically and any jobs in the DAG will run as the
    user who submitted the DAG.

    Jobs can be defined in a virtual cluster with variable placeholders,
    e.g. ``{{ inputdir }}``. Currently the fields supporting variable expansion
    are Spark application name, Spark arguments, and Spark configurations.
    Variables can be passed to the operator as a dictionary of key-value string
    pairs. In addition to any user variables passed via the ``variables``
    parameter, the following standard Airflow macros are automatically
    populated as variables by the operator (see
    https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/macros-ref):

    * ``ds``: the execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
    * ``ds_nodash``: the execution date as ``YYYYMMDD``
    * ``ts``: execution date in ISO 8601 format
    * ``ts_nodash``: execution date in ISO 8601 format without '-', ':' or
          timezone information
    * ``run_id``: the run_id of the current DAG run

    If a CDE job needs to run with a different configuration, a task can be
    configured with runtime overrides. For example to override the Spark
    executor memory and cores for a task and to supply an additional config
    parameter you could supply the following dictionary can be supplied to
    the ``overrides`` parameter::

        {
            'spark': {
                'executorMemory': '8g',
                'executorCores': '4',
                'conf': {
                    'spark.kubernetes.memoryOverhead': '2048'
                }
            }
        }

    See the CDE Jobs API documentation for the full list of parameters that
    can be overridden.

    Via the ``wait`` parameter, jobs can either be submitted asynchronously to
    the API (``wait=False``) or the task can wait until the job is complete
    before exiting the task (default is ``wait=True``). If ``wait`` is
    ``True``, the task exit status will reflect the final status of the
    submitted job (or the task will fail on timeout if specified). If ``wait``
    is ``False`` the task status will reflect whether the job was successfully
    submitted to the API or not.

    Note: all parameters below can also be provided through the
    ``default_args`` field of the DAG.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:CdeRunJobOperator`

    :param job_name: the name of the job in the target cluster, required
    :param connection_id: the Airflow connection id for the target API
        endpoint, default value ``'cde_runtime_api'``
    :param variables: a dictionary of key-value pairs to populate in the
        job configuration, default empty dict.
    :param overrides: a dictionary of key-value pairs to override in the
        job configuration, default empty dict.
    :param wait: if set to true, the operator will wait for the job to
        complete in the target cluster. The task exit status will reflect the
        status of the completed job. Default ``True``
    :param timeout: the maximum time to wait in seconds for the job to
        complete if ``wait=True``. If set to ``None``, 0 or a negative number,
        the task will never be timed out. Default ``0``.
    :param job_poll_interval: the interval in seconds at which the target API
        is polled for the job status. Default ``10``.
    :param api_retries: the number of times to retry an API request in the event
        of a connection failure or non-fatal API error. Default ``9``.
